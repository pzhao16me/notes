## Agile mainfesto
- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
- Working software over comprehensive documentation
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
- Responding to change over following a plan
## Agile principles
- Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
- Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.
- Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.
- Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.
- Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.
- The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.
- Working software is the primary measure of progress.
- Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.
- Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.
- Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount of work not done--is essential.
- The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.
- At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.

### User stories
#### what are user stories?
- User stories are short, simple descriptions of a feature told from the perspective of the person who desires the new capability, usually a user or customer of the system. They typically follow a simple template:
- As a < type of user >, I want < some goal > so that < some reason >.
- As a < type of user >, I want < some goal >.
- As a < type of user >, I want < some goal > because < some reason >.
#### how to write user stories?
- 1. Write the user story
- 2. Break down the user story into tasks
- 3. Estimate the tasks
- 4. Prioritize the user stories
- 5. Plan the sprint
- 6. Execute the sprint
- 7. Review the sprint
- 8. Retrospect the sprint
#### what are the benefits of user stories?
- 1. User stories are simple and easy to understand
- 2. User stories are short and easy to remember
- 3. User stories are easy to estimate
- 4. User stories are easy to prioritize
- 5. User stories are easy to plan
- 6. User stories are easy to execute
- 7. User stories are easy to review
- 8. User stories are easy to retrospect
### Planning Poker
#### what is planning poker?
- Planning poker is a consensus-based technique for estimating, mostly used to estimate effort or relative size of user stories in software development. It is a variation of the Wideband Delphi method. It is most commonly used in agile software development, in particular in Scrum and Extreme Programming.

### Daily Stand-up
#### what is daily stand-up?
- The daily stand-up is a short meeting where the team members get together to give a status update on their work, discuss any issues they are facing, and plan the work for the day.
### Sprint Planning
#### what is sprint planning?
- Sprint planning is a meeting where the team gets together to discuss which user stories they will work on during the sprint, and how they will implement those user stories.

### Sprint Review
#### what is sprint review?
- The sprint review is a meeting where the team gets together with the stakeholders to demonstrate the working software they have built during the sprint, and to get feedback from the stakeholders.

### Sprint Retrospective
#### what is sprint retrospective?
- The sprint retrospective is a meeting where the team gets together to discuss what went well during the sprint, what didn't go well during the sprint, and what they can do to improve the way they work in the next sprint.
### Backlog Grooming
#### what is backlog grooming?
- Backlog grooming is a meeting where the team gets together to discuss the user stories in the backlog, and to estimate the user stories that are not yet estimated.
### Continuous Integration
#### what is continuous integration?
- Continuous integration is a software development practice where members of a team integrate their work frequently, usually each person integrates at least daily - leading to multiple integrations per day. Each integration is verified by an automated build (including test) to detect integration errors as quickly as possible.
### Test-Driven Development
#### what is Test-Driven Development?
- Test-driven development (TDD) is a software development process that relies on the repetition of a very short development cycle: first the developer writes an (initially failing) automated test case that defines a desired improvement or new function, then produces the minimum amount of code to pass that test, and finally refactors the new code to acceptable standards.
### Pair Programming
#### What is  Pair Programming
- Pair programming is an agile software development technique in which two programmers work together at one workstation. One, the driver, writes code while the other, the observer or navigator, reviews each line of code as it is typed in. The two programmers switch roles frequently.

### Refactoring
#### what is refactoring?
- Refactoring is the process of changing a software system in such a way that it does not alter the external behavior of the code yet improves its internal structure. It is a disciplined way to clean up code that minimizes the chances of introducing bugs. In essence when you refactor you are improving the design of the code after it has been written.

### Collective Code Ownership
#### what is collective code ownership?
- Collective code ownership is a software development practice where every developer has the right to change any line of code in the system. It is a way to reduce the risk of knowledge silos and key person dependencies.
### Continuous Delivery
#### what is continuous delivery?
- Continuous delivery is a software development practice where code changes are automatically built, tested, and prepared for a release to production. It expands upon continuous integration by deploying all code changes to a testing environment and/or a production environment after the build stage.
### Continuous Deployment
#### what is continuous deployment?
- Continuous deployment is a software development practice where every code change goes through the entire pipeline and is put into production, automatically, resulting in many production deployments every day. It expands upon continuous delivery by deploying all code changes to production.
### Kanban Board
#### what is kanban board?
- A Kanban board is a tool for visualizing the work that needs to be done, the work that is in progress, and the work that has been completed. It is a way to optimize the flow of work.
### Burn-down Chart
#### what is burn-down chart?
- A burn-down chart is a graphical representation of work left to do versus time. The outstanding work (or backlog) is often on the vertical axis, with time along the horizontal. That is, it is a run chart of outstanding work. It is useful for predicting when all of the work will be completed.
### Burn-up Chart
#### what is burn-up chart?
- A burn-up chart is a graphical representation of work completed versus time. The work completed is often on the vertical axis, with time along the horizontal. That is, it is a run chart of work completed. It is useful for predicting when all of the work will be completed.
### Velocity
#### what is velocity?
- Velocity is a measure of the amount of work a Team can tackle during a single Sprint and is the key metric in Scrum. Velocity is calculated at the end of the Sprint by totaling the Points for all fully completed User Stories.
## Role in Agile
- Product Owner
- Scrum Master
- Development Team
- Stakeholder
- Customer
- User
- Manager
- Executive
- Sponsor
### product Owner
#### what is product owner? what it menas in agile?
- The product owner is the person responsible for maximizing the value of the product resulting from the work of the development team. The product owner is the sole person responsible for managing the product backlog. Product backlog management includes:
- Clearly expressing product backlog items;
- Ordering the items in the product backlog to best achieve goals and missions;
- Optimizing the value of the work the development team performs;
- Ensuring that the product backlog is visible, transparent, and clear to all, and shows what the Scrum Team will work on next; and,
- Ensuring the development team understands items in the product backlog to the level needed.
- The product owner may do the above work, or have the development team do it. However, the product owner remains accountable.
- The Product Owner is one person, not a committee. The Product Owner may represent the desires of a committee in the Product Backlog, but those wanting to change a Product Backlog item’s priority must address the Product Owner.
- For the Product Owner to succeed, the entire organization must respect his or her decisions. The Product Owner’s decisions are visible in the content and ordering of the Product Backlog. No one is allowed to tell the Development Team to work from a different set of requirements, and the Development Team isn’t allowed to act on what anyone else says.
### Scrum Master
#### what is scrum master? what it means in agile?
- The Scrum Master is responsible for promoting and supporting Scrum as defined in the Scrum Guide. Scrum Masters do this by helping everyone understand Scrum theory, practices, rules, and values.
- The Scrum Master is a servant-leader for the Scrum Team. The Scrum Master helps those outside the Scrum Team understand which of their interactions with the Scrum Team are helpful and which aren’t. The Scrum Master helps everyone change these interactions to maximize the value created by the Scrum Team.
- Scrum Master Service to the Product Owner
- Finding techniques for effective Product Backlog management;
- Helping the Scrum Team understand the need for clear and concise Product Backlog items;
- Understanding product planning in an empirical environment;
- Ensuring the Product Owner knows how to arrange the Product Backlog to maximize value;
- Understanding and practicing agility; and,
- Facilitating Scrum events as requested or needed.
- Scrum Master Service to the Development Team
- Coaching the Development Team in self-organization and cross-functionality;
- Helping the Development Team to create high-value products;
- Removing impediments to the Development Team’s progress;
### Development Team
#### what is development team? what it means in agile?
- The Development Team consists of professionals who do the work of delivering a potentially releasable Increment of “Done” product at the end of each Sprint. Only members of the Development Team create the Increment.
- Development Teams are structured and empowered by the organization to organize and manage their own work. The resulting synergy optimizes the Development Team’s overall efficiency and effectiveness.
- Development Teams have the following characteristics:
- They are self-organizing. No one (not even the Scrum Master) tells the Development Team how to turn Product Backlog into Increments of potentially releasable functionality;
- Development Teams are cross-functional, with all of the skills as a team necessary to create a product Increment;
- Scrum recognizes no titles for Development Team members other than Developer, regardless of the work being performed by the person; there are no exceptions to this rule;
- Scrum recognizes no sub-teams in the Development Team, regardless of particular domains that need to be addressed like testing or business analysis; there are no exceptions to this rule; and,
- Individual Development Team members may have specialized skills and areas of focus, but accountability belongs to the Development Team as a whole.
### Stakeholder
#### what is stakeholder? what it means in agile?
- A "stakeholder" in project management and software development refers to any individual, group, or organization that has a direct or indirect interest in the outcome of a project. They could be sponsors of the project, users, the development team, or anyone who could be affected by the project.

- In Agile development, the concept of "stakeholder" is particularly important. Agile methodologies emphasize close collaboration with stakeholders to better understand their needs and expectations, thereby delivering maximum value. Stakeholders can be involved in defining requirements, setting priorities, and reviewing completed work. In this way, Agile development ensures that the direction of the project aligns with stakeholders' expectations and can respond quickly to changes
### Customer
#### what is customer? what it means in agile?
- A customer is a person or organization that buys goods or services from a store or business. Customers are important because they drive revenues; without them, businesses cannot continue to exist.
### User
#### what is user? what it means in agile?
- A user is a person who uses a computer or network service. Users generally use a system or a software product without the technical expertise required to fully understand it. Power users use advanced features of programs, though they are not necessarily capable of computer programming and system administration.
### Manager
#### what is manager? what it means in agile?
- A manager is a person who is responsible for the work of others. Managers have subordinates. They are accountable for the work of their subordinates. Managers are responsible for planning and directing the work of a group of individuals, monitoring their work, and taking corrective action when necessary.
### Product vision statement?
#### what are the product vision statements?
- A product vision statement is a short summary that describes the product's or service's purpose, its intended audience, and the goals it aims to accomplish. A product vision statement should be short and sweet, while also being informative enough to provide stakeholders with context for the product's purpose.
#### How to create the product vision statement?
- 1. Identify the product
- 2. Identify the target customer
- 3. Identify the customer needs
- 4. Identify the customer benefits
- 5. Identify the customer value
- 6. Identify the business goals
- 7. Identify the business objectives
- 8. Identify the business outcomes
- 9. Identify the business value
- 10. Identify the product vision statement
#### If the product is a online shop, how to create the product vision statement?
    The product is identified as an online shop. This is the main deliverable of the project.
    The target customer is identified as people who want to buy things online. Understanding the target customer is crucial for shaping the product's features and marketing strategy.
    The customer needs are identified as the ability to buy things online. This is the primary problem that the product aims to solve for its users.
    The customer benefits are also identified as the ability to buy things online. This is what the customer gains from using the product.
    The customer value is again identified as the ability to buy things online. This is the unique value proposition that the product offers to its customers.
    The business goals are identified as making money. This is the overarching aim that the business hopes to achieve through the product.
    The business objectives are also identified as making money. These are the specific, measurable steps that the business will take to achieve its goals.
    The business outcomes are again identified as making money. These are the expected results of achieving the business objectives.
    The business value is identified as making money. This is the financial or strategic value that the product brings to the business.
    Finally, the product vision statement is defined as "an online shop that allows people to buy things online". This is a brief, inspiring description of what the product aims to achieve in the long term.
    Each of these steps is important in Agile development, as they help to ensure that the product is designed and built to deliver maximum value to both the customers and the business.
